## Overview

This article argues that "work data"—the work output of knowledge workers—is the single most valuable data source for LLM (Large Language Model) training, surpassing public internet content, social media, and other sources. The author presents nine reasons supporting this claim, discusses the conflict of interest between data owners and AI companies, and explores potential win-win scenarios for data sharing and AI development.

## Why Work Data Is So Valuable for LLM Training

### 1. Best Quality Data Humanity Has Produced
- Work data is more factual, trustworthy, and produced by vetted professionals.
- Reflects industry best practices, deeper reasoning, and more complex patterns.
- Often labeled by quality and performance metrics.
- Incentives are aligned: workers are rewarded for high-quality outputs.

### 2. Manifests the Most Valuable Human Knowledge
- Real business value lies in skills businesses pay for, best extracted from work outputs.

### 3. Readily Available for AI Training
- SaaS companies often have access to their users' work outputs in cloud storage (legal use is a separate issue).

### 4. Orders of Magnitude Larger Than Public Internet Content
- Individuals produce far more work data than public internet content.
- Incumbent companies (e.g., Microsoft, Google) have access to vast amounts of work data.

### 5. Contains Unique Insights
- Each business's data reflects unique trade secrets and differentiation.
- Businesses are protective of their data because it contains their competitive advantages.

### 6. Has Hidden Gems
- Work data may contain patterns and insights not yet recognized by humans.
- AI could discover new patterns from this untapped data.

### 7. Cleaner and More Structured
- Work products are often organized, labeled, and structured for collaboration.
- Some data is generated through rigorous processes and approvals.
- Companies can enforce data conventions and structure.

### 8. Legally and Ethically Complex
- Work data is private property, protected by law and company policies.
- There are significant legal and ethical considerations around its use for AI training.

## The Opportunity and Conflict

- **Software engineers and data professionals** have a unique opportunity to advocate for the acquisition and ethical use of work data.
- There is a conflict of interest: AI companies want data for training, while data owners want to protect their interests and competitive advantages.
- The ideal scenario is a win-win: data owners contribute data and receive a stake in the resulting AI models, sharing in the profits and success.
- Data should be treated as capital, and data contribution as a capital investment, with proportional rewards.
- This model could address knowledge workers' fears of losing their livelihood to AI by giving them equity in the AI models built from their work.

## Trade Secrets vs. AI Training

- Employers may be willing to share non-differentiating work data in exchange for better AI services.
- For data that represents competitive advantage, custom or white-label AI solutions are preferable, ensuring exclusivity and ownership.

## Conclusion

Work data is the next frontier for GenAI, offering unmatched quality, scale, and business value for LLM training. The future of AI training lies in finding ethical, legal, and mutually beneficial ways to leverage this resource, ensuring both AI progress and fair rewards for data contributors.
