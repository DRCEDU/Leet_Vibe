## 1. The State of AI Agents: Everyone’s Doing It, Nobody Knows Why

- 95% of companies use generative AI; 79% implement agents, but only 1% consider their implementations mature (Bain, 2024).
- Many teams build agentic systems for the novelty, not necessity, leading to complexity and maintenance headaches.
- Real production agent systems (e.g., Klarna, BCG) require significant investment in infrastructure, monitoring, and fallback systems.

## 2. Technical Reality Check: Workflows vs Agents

### Workflows: The Reliable Friend Who Shows Up On Time
- Orchestrated, explicit control flow (like a recipe).
- Predictable, debuggable, cost-predictable.
- Example: RAG pipelines, prompt chains.
- Easy to monitor, test, and maintain.

**Example Workflow (Python):**
```python
def customer_support_workflow(customer_message, customer_id):
    """Predefined workflow with explicit control flow"""
    # Step 1: Classify the message type
    classification_prompt = f"Classify this message: {customer_message}\nOptions: billing, technical, general"
    message_type = llm_call(classification_prompt)
    # Step 2: Route based on classification
    if message_type == "billing":
        billing_data = get_customer_billing(customer_id)
        response_prompt = f"Answer this billing question: {customer_message}\nBilling data: {billing_data}"
    elif message_type == "technical":
        product_data = get_product_info(customer_id)
        response_prompt = f"Answer this technical question: {customer_message}\nProduct info: {product_data}"
    else:
        response_prompt = f"Provide a helpful response: {customer_message}"
    # Step 3: Generate response
    response = llm_call(response_prompt)
    # Step 4: Log the interaction
    log_interaction(customer_id, customer_message, response)
    return response
```

### Agents: The Smart Kid Who Sometimes Goes Rogue
- Autonomous, LLM decides next steps, tool use, and when to finish.
- Flexible, but can be unpredictable, expensive, and hard to debug.
- Example: Multi-agent systems (CrewAI, LangGraph).
- Useful for dynamic, open-ended, or multi-step tasks where the path isn’t known in advance.

## 3. The Hidden Costs Nobody Talks About
- Agents require more infrastructure: monitoring, observability, fallback, budget controls.
- Debugging is harder (reasoning loops, unpredictable plans).
- Maintenance and onboarding are more complex.
- Token usage and costs can spiral out of control.

---

## 4. When Agents Actually Make Sense
- When the task is open-ended, requires dynamic planning, or involves tool selection and chaining.
- When the environment is unpredictable or the workflow must adapt in real time.
- When you need autonomous decision-making (e.g., customer support bots that escalate, research assistants).

## 5. When Workflows Are Obviously Better
- When the process is well-defined, repeatable, and testable.
- When you need reliability, cost control, and easy debugging.
- For most business use cases, start with workflows.

---

## 6. A Decision Framework That Actually Works
- Don’t make single-factor decisions (e.g., just for flexibility or novelty).
- Score your use case on:
  - Predictability
  - Complexity
  - Need for autonomy
  - Cost sensitivity
  - Maintenance burden
- Use a scoring matrix to decide if agentic or workflow is best.

---

## 7. The Plot Twist: You Don’t Have to Choose
- Hybrid architectures are possible: workflows can call agents for specific steps, or agents can use workflows as subroutines.
- Build modularly so you can swap approaches as requirements evolve.

---

## 8. Production Deployment — Where Theory Meets Reality

![Image: Author's diagram of production deployment considerations: monitoring, cost, security, and testing. (See original article for image.)](#)

### Monitoring
- Agents: Need observability for reasoning steps, tool calls, and loops.
- Workflows: Standard logging and error handling suffice.

### Cost Management
- Agents: Track token usage, set budget limits, monitor for runaway costs.
- Workflows: Easier to predict and control costs.

### Security
- Agents: More risk (autonomous actions, tool access). Use guardrails, permissions, and sandboxing.
- Workflows: Fewer moving parts, easier to secure.

### Testing Methodologies
- Agents: Require sandboxing, staged deployments, regression tests, and human-in-the-loop reviews.
- Workflows: Easier to unit test, mock, and validate.

## 9. The Honest Recommendation

> **Start with workflows. Add agents only when you can clearly justify the need.**

- Workflows are reliable, testable, explainable, and cost-predictable.
- Agents are powerful for the right problems, but add complexity and risk.
- Build for resilience and real-world value, not just for novelty.
