### Code Block Conversion Example
```python
import os
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class BaseRawDataPipeline(ABC):
    def __init__(
        self,
        input_data_path: str | os.PathLike,
        output_data_path: str | os.PathLike
    ):
        self.input_data_path = input_data_path
        self.output_data_path = output_data_path

    @abstractmethod
    def transform(self, raw_data):
        """Transform the raw data."""
        ...
```

## Conclusion
